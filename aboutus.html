    <h1>About us!</h1>
    <h3>Fun facts</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p>I used a website "log in" page for reference to create this project (I hope that's not cheating, I just wanted to dive into the code, heh).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The name <b>"Maped"</b> comes from a random highlighter I found on my desk.</p></li>
    <li><p>During this project I realised I completely forgot what a <b>div</b> is. I decided to complete the entire project first, then I went back to research it and add in one.</p></li>
    <li><p>...I in fact, did not add any <b>divs</b>.</p>
    
</ul>
